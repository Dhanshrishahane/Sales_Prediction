# Sales_Prediction using Python
This project involves building a sales prediction model using Linear Regression. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory visualizations, and model evaluation to forecast sales based on advertising budgets, providing valuable insights for marketing optimization.

Key Points:

Objective: Predict sales prices for given advertising budgets.
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Renamed columns for better understanding.
Visualizations:
Scatter plots to identify relationships between variables.
Histograms to understand the data distribution.
Correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships.
Model Building:
Trained a Linear Regression model using the prepared dataset.
Evaluated model performance with RMSE and RÂ² metrics.
Prediction:
Predicted sales for new advertising budgets with actionable insights.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Analysis: pandas, NumPy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Modeling: sklearn, statsmodels

Benefits:

Business Insights: Provides actionable predictions for optimized advertising budgets.
Data-Driven Decisions: Facilitates better planning with sales forecasts.
Scalability: The model can adapt to various datasets and scenarios.
Efficiency: Saves time and resources by automating predictions.
This project showcases the power of statistical modeling and data analysis in solving real-world business challenges.
